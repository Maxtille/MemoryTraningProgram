# MemoryTraningProgram
a little console application that help you memorize different things.

Project written in c++, at the beggening I made it for me to studdy english verbs and cinema history (I'm a french-speaking guy) so everything is "coded in french" and has been made a few years ago. So maybe we can find some incorrect way of writting code in my main, just remember I was young when I started this project on my own.

In the dat folder there are all the files the program is using.
